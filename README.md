# WeatherX
This is a modern responsive Weather Web Application built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays:
• Current location weather  
• City-based weather search  
• Hourly forecast slider  
• 5-day weather forecast  
• Temperature trend chart  
• Dark/Light mode UI  
• Fully responsive glassmorphism design  

This project demonstrates API integration, DOM manipulation, responsive UI design, and real-world frontend development practices.
